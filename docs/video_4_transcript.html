    Everything or anyone is accessible with a few clicks on your phone or computer. For so long, everyone thought this was a privilege until
    we finally woke to reality about how our data is managed. Controlling personal data has become the core-front to gain and influence people’s
    behavior. Companies are often after people's information for their own gain. People have never been more exposed when it comes to their own security
    in data protection. With this serious problem, our solution DataManage is finally here to address this issue effectively - a simple app that enables
    anyone to control who has access to their data.">

            <br><p tabindex="0">
                We are back to the home page and we are now going to do a business search by clicking on the “Business search” button at the bottom, in the center.<br>
                You then can click on the search bar, where it says “Business search…”, and your keyboard will pop up.<br>
                We are going to, here, search for “Facebook” by typing F-A, and the suggestion for “Facebook” shows up.<br>
                Then, we click on the “Search” button underneath the search box.<br>
                You will be shown the information that the business selected, in this case Facebook, has about you.<br>
                And if you scroll down, you will be able to click to see the grounds on which they have such information.<br>
                They are the same grounds shown in the previous video.<br>
                By scrolling down, you can click “I understand” at the center, right above the navigation bar.<br>
                And you will be redirected to the page informing you about the information the business has about you.<br>
                Once again, if you scroll to the bottom, you will be shown the option “Actions”.<br>
                This time, without “Actions for all”, since you have only the possibility of selecting one business at a time.<br>
                Then, you will be prompted to select what your requests are.<br>
                In this case, we are going to request correction and to have personal data deleted.<br>
                And then we are going to click on “Send” at the bottom of the page, in the center, right above the navigation bar.<br>
                You will again be shown a message box saying that you have now submitted the form.<br>
                And you can exit that box by clicking on the check at the bottom of said box.<br>
                Now you are going to be redirected to the main page, where you will see that there is a new notification at the top left of the page.<br>
                Once again, the top notification will be about your latest request.<br>
