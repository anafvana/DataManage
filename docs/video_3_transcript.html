    Everything or anyone is accessible with a few clicks on your phone or computer. For so long, everyone thought this was a privilege until
    we finally woke to reality about how our data is managed. Controlling personal data has become the core-front to gain and influence people’s
    behavior. Companies are often after people's information for their own gain. People have never been more exposed when it comes to their own security
    in data protection. With this serious problem, our solution DataManage is finally here to address this issue effectively - a simple app that enables
    anyone to control who has access to their data.">

            <br><p tabindex="0">
                You are now at the main page.<br>
                At the center you will find two buttons, «personal search» and «business search».<br>
                We can now click on «personal search» to do a personal search.<br>
                This will direct you to a list of businesses that have information about you.<br>
                On the upper part of the screen, you can now find a button that looks like a list.<br>
                By clicking on it, you can select different filters, for example online stores, social media or entertainment.<br>
                For this demonstration, we will select «online stores» by clicking on the first checkbox to the left.<br>
                Then, we will close this pop up window by clicking on the checkmark in the centre, above the navbar.<br>
                This will bring you to the list of businesses with this filter.<br>
                Here, we are going to select the 4 first ones.<br>
                And then we scroll to the bottom of the page where we can click on «information».<br>
                By doing so, you will be directed to the page where you can see the information that the first of your selected businesses has about you.<br>
                If you scroll a little down the list, you will find the grounds on which the business has collected information about you.<br>
                If you click inside this section,  a pop up will show, and then you will have access to more details.<br>
                It can be due to agreement, labor law, interest balancing, legal obligations, legal claims, law or consent.<br>
                Once you have read through all of that, you can scroll to the bottom of the page and click on «I understand» at the bottom in the center, right above the navbar.<br>
                You will then get back to the previous page.<br>
                If you scroll to the bottom, you will see two buttons in the middle, «Actions» and «A ctions for all».<br>
                In this case, «Actions for all» is deactivated because you still have business to look at.<br>
                «Actions», however, is activated, because you can select it and request certain things specifically from that business.<br>
                At the bottom, to the right of the «Actions for all» button, there is an arrow pointing right.<br>
                When you click there, you will be shown the second business in your list.<br>
                You can scroll down, once again click right arrow, scroll down, again, click the right arrow, and finally we are on the fourth business.<br>
                Where you can click on «Actions for all» , which is shown at the bottom of the page, at the center, right above the navigation bar.<br>
                You will then be prompted to select what you want to do. <br>
                Would you like to request insight, request correction, or request personal data deleted.<br>
                You can select whatever you want by clicking on the checkboxes on the left.<br>
                After you have selected, in this case we have selected «Request insight», you then press on «send» at the bottom and a message box will show up, saying that you have submitted your request.<br>
                You can then click at the checkmark at the bottom of the popup to close the message.<br>
                You will then be redirected to the home page and you can see that there is a notification at the top right of the page.<br>
                Click on the notification bell to open your message panel.<br>
                The top one will inform you about your latest request.
