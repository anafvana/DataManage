    Everything or anyone is accessible with a few clicks on your phone or computer. For so long, everyone thought this was a privilege until
    we finally woke to reality about how our data is managed. Controlling personal data has become the core-front to gain and influence people’s
    behavior. Companies are often after people's information for their own gain. People have never been more exposed when it comes to their own security
    in data protection. With this serious problem, our solution DataManage is finally here to address this issue effectively - a simple app that enables
    anyone to control who has access to their data.">

            <br><p tabindex="0">The world has become a place where everything we see and do is shared on social media. It is the new way of communicating with friends,
            loved ones, and strangers.</p>
            <br><p tabindex="0">However, there are people and companies that are after your information for their own gain. It can be on a personal level, like doxing,
                where people share and misuse your personal information without your consent. It can also be on a global level, from targeted ads to fake news, which can
                change the way people think and behave. The power of information is beyond what most of us imagine, so how can we control it?

            <br><p tabindex="0">With the help from our new app, you will be able to control your personal life online. Our app DataManage will help you gain control over
                what you share, but also what information corporations have about you. You will become the narrator over your own personal information.
                You can find more information and a demonstration of how the app works on the "How it works"-page.</p>
            <br><h2 tabindex="0">Why is DataManage so important, and why should you use it?</h2>
            <br><p tabindex="0">Like we mentioned earlier in the problem, we live in a world where our personal data is as valuable as our passport. However, we treat it like the opposite. With DataManage, you no longer need to
                worry about reading the terms and conditions. The app will tell you exactly what you are consenting to, but also what personal information you are giving the website.
            </p>
            <br><p tabindex="0">In our survey, people were asked if they were concerned about not having control over the information they provide online. 59.9% of people answered that they are either fairly or very concerned, whereas 33.3%
                of people answered they are not very concerned. This could be because of two things; lack of knowledge on privacy, and how normalized sharing your personal life online has become.

            How concerned are you about not having complete control over the information you provide online? 9.8 % say they are very concerned. 47.1 % say they are fairly concerned.
            33.3 % say they are not very concerned. 3.9 % say they are not concerned at all. 5.9 % say they don't know."></section>
            <br><p tabindex="0">However, when people were asked if they would like to have more control over the information and data they share online, most people selected yes (73.5%). This shows that with the right tools, people would be
                interested in the protection of their own information. A portion of the people answering the survey selected maybe (20.6%). Connected to the graph mentioned above about how concerned people are about not having complete control, one speculation could be that with the right solution and
                knowledge, people would be more likely to want to have more control.</p>
            <br><section class = "graf"><img src = "Pictures/Graf5.png" class = "problem-howoften" tabindex="0" alt = "Graph representing results from our survey.

            like more control. 5.9 % say the don't care."></section>
            <br><p tabindex="0">Based on this, it is safe to say that people want to control their own personal data. With the right knowledge, more people will also become more aware of how important it is. We want to give people that control,
                but more importantly, we want to give people their right to personal data privacy.
