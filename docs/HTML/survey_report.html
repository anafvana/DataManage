            <p tabindex="0">
                Between the 1st of November 2019 and the 12th of November 2019, an informal survey was
                conducted through Google Sheets, as part of the final project in DAPE1200 - Web
                development and inclusive design. The group of OsloMet students composed by Ana Flávia
                Vital, Andrea Bjørge, Anine Schjøth Semmen, Jannicke Merete Svendsen, Terese Bjørseth
                and Yvan Bayisabe had as its goal to understand the product that was being designed was,
                in fact, a solution to a real problem. In order to answer that question, it was first necessary to
                understand whether data collection was, in fact, an issue identified by internet users from
                different backgrounds.
            </p><br>
            <p tabindex="0">
                There was a general concern that, as suggested by the Special Eurobarometer 487a , a
                report on the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the use of internet in the
                European Union, there would be a general sense of awareness of one’s rights on the web
                and implications of using it. Regardless of how illusory such sense of awareness proved to
                be, the group was aware that people who are not concerned with a matter will not buy
                solutions to it and therefore decided to inquire deeper, both by expanding the scope beyond
                the European Union and by bringing examples of real terms of services thousands or even
                millions consent to.
            </p><br>
            <p tabindex="0">
                It was then agreed that the most viable way of acquiring the necessary information would be
                through the elaboration of a questionnaire to be shared on the aforementioned students’
                social media. Taking inspiration from the Special Eurobarometer 487a report , the
                questionnaire was elaborated so as to have three parts:</p><br>
                <ol class = "survey-list-1">
                <li tabindex="0">A first one where we would map the profile of those answering our questions, taking
                into account gender, age group, national and cultural background, and current
                country of residence.
                </li>
                <li tabindex="0">A second one aimed at understanding people’s behaviours online and their opinions,
                including objective questions (such as regarding user habits), more concrete cases
                and sections where users would be able to express their thoughts.
                </li>
                <li tabindex="0">A third and final portion focused on user’s knowledge about rights and laws
                concerning the internet.
                </li>
                </ol>
                <br><p tabindex="0">The goal of the survey was to reach the biggest number of people with as many different
                characteristics as possible. The international background of some of the members of the
                groups was taken into advantage, so that the survey was posted not only on Facebook
                personal profiles, but also on Facebook groups such as New to Oslo and Italiani a Oslo .
                Additionally, family members of all ages were engaged, so as to ensure different age groups
                were also taken into account. In total, the survey reached 102 respondents.
                </p>
            <br><h2 tabindex="0">Part 1 - Personal Information</h2><br>
            <p tabindex="0">
                The goal of asking for respondent’s personal information was to be aware of the profile of
                those partaking in the survey. As the goal was to have a diverse pool of internet users as our
                source for information, it was important for us to understand whether the research would be,
                in fact, what we needed.
            </p><br>
            <p tabindex="0">
                There was a small prevalence of female respondents (58), whereas 41 (40.2%) of the
                partakers were men, 2 (2%) were not encompassed by the terms male/female and 1 (1%)
                preferred not to answer.
            </p><br>
            <br><img src = "../Pictures/Report_graph_1.png" tabindex="0" class = "report-graph" alt = "Pie chart showing survey results regarding gender. All the relevant percentages have been or will be stated in the text"><br>
            <br><p tabindex="0">
                Despite the small presence of respondents whose gender identity diverges from the binary
                standard, their presence was still taken as a positive sign that the survey reached a
                community that is often neglected in the design of products and solutions. Additionally, the
                fact that there was no absolute prevalence of a single gender was considered a step forward
                in the reach of our goal for a diverse pool.
            <br></p>
            <br><p tabindex="0">
                In regards to age, over half (57.8%) of the respondents were aged between 18 and 24 years
                old (59), whereas 31.4% (32) were in the next age range of 25-39. A total of 5 users (4.9%
                were aged between 40 and 54; 4 (3.9%) users were over 55 and only 2 (2%) were younger
                than 18.
            </p><br>
            <br><img src = "../Pictures/Report_graph_2.png" tabindex="0" class = "report-graph" alt = "Pie chart showing survey results regarding age. All the relevant percentages have been or will be stated in the text"><br>
            <br><p tabindex="0">
                Taking into account that “[t]he younger the respondent, the more likely they are to use the
                Internet daily, and the less likely they are to never use it” (European Union, 2019, p.8), it is
                clear that the results are not optimal. Although the age group from 18 to 39 years old might
                be most likely to currently consume a product related to the internet, as they have the
                economic means to engage independently in the market and are simultaneously relatively
                young and therefore mostly online, reaching younger generations is a priority for us as
                product designers, as we would not like for our solution to become outdated and irrelevant to
                those who will soon be the main actors.
            </p><br>
            <p tabindex="0">
                Regarding mapping the location of our respondents, the group reached an agreement that it
                was best to consider both their current location and their cultural background.
            </p><br>
            <p tabindex="0">
                The first question aimed to map where our respondents had spent most of their lives. By
                avoiding to ask about one’s nationality, our goal was to have notions of their cultural
                background such as potential access to internet throughout most of their lives, probable
                living standards, languages they most likely speak. As it was not the main scope of the
                survey, we opted not to ask more questions of the kind directly, leaving the replies we had
                as an indicator of how broad our reach may or may not be.
            </p><br>
            <br><img src = "../Pictures/Report_graph_3.png" tabindex="0" class = "report-graph" alt = "Pie chart showing survey results regarding where the respondents have spent most of their lives. All the relevant percentages have been or will be stated in the text"><br>
            <br><p tabindex="0">
                There were respondents from 19 countries, with a prevalence of 49% of people who lived
                most of their lives in Norway.
            </p><br>
            <p tabindex="0">
                Despite the large number of respondents in the area concerned by the General Data
                Protection Regulation, our results seemed useful, as they show users from other countries
                that were not encompassed by the Special Eurobarometer 487a report . Although a wider
                reach would be ideal, the results still seemed relevant so as to expand on the information we
                had.
            </p><br>
            <p tabindex="0">
                Regarding the place of residence, its importance relates to the internet regulations in force.
                Although many of our subsequent questions brought about rights pertaining to European
                regulations, the scope of the survey was still transcontinental. In fact, the product the group
                is developing relies partially on rights and policies enforced by the General Data Protection
                Regulation. A much higher concentration was noticeable on the question regarding people’s current
                country of residency, showing that 73 % had Norway as their country of residency, making it less diverse than ideal.

            <p tabindex="0">
                In the second section, the goal was to understand respondent’s online behaviour. Both
                objective questions and hypothetical cases were used so as to achieve that goal.
            </p><br>
            <p tabindex="0">
                The first question was about the frequency of internet use, with 99% (101) of respondents
                saying they accessed it every day and only 1 (1%) doing it less than once a month. The aim
                of this question was to evaluate how familiar our respondents were likely to be with the
                internet, taking exposure to it as the main factor.

            <br><p tabindex="0">
                Following, the respondents were required to evaluate their opinions in some hypothetical
                scenarios. Such scenarios were, in fact, built on the basis of real privacy policies from big
                websites or softwares that are widely used.
            </p><br>
            <p tabindex="0">
                Question number one was: You create an account on a website where you can write public
                posts that may include pictures or videos. Every time you are on that website, information
                about the device you are using, the application version and even your precise location is
                collected. Your private personal data is shared with third-party service providers. After some
                months of use, you delete your account, hoping to erase all traces of what you had posted.
                However, the information you had previously made public is still retained.Not long after, the
                company goes bankrupt. Your information is sold as part of the transaction. How do you
                feel?

            <p tabindex="0">
                This question was based on Twitter’s privacy policy , which states:

                Fifty percent of respondents (51) said “ If I knew this, I would have been thinking twice about
                giving my consent”, followed by 16.7% (17) which stated “If I knew this, I would never have

                they weren’t responsible, then they are not”. Finally, 4 (4%) claimed they “don’t care much.

            <br><p tabindex="0">
                The final section aimed at understanding how aware respondents are (or believe they are) in
                relation to laws and regulations in the field of data protection, as well as their opinions and
                behaviours in that regard. Most of the rights taken into consideration in the survey are based
                on the General Data Protection Regulations (European Parliament, 2016). Questions,
                however, were shaped in a way that respondents who knew about the existence of a certain
                right but not within their country could express that.

                The first question was aimed at self-evaluation in relation to one’s knowledge about laws or
                regulations regarding data protection in the respondent’s country. The aim was to assess
                whether consumers could potentially be interested in our project. After all, users who
                consider themselves aware of laws and regulations they are subjected to, and believe those
                are enough to protect their data privacy, will not be interested in a product aiming at
                protecting their online information.

                response was “Somewhat. I think I have heard or read something about it, but I only have
                vague notions”, with 37 (36.3%). The remaining 24.5% (25) voted “No, I have no significant

                agree to without fully and thoroughly reading. This point was shown by our results, with a
                majority of 30.4% (31 respondents) never reading them and 28.4% (29) almost never
                reading or partially reading through them. Nineteen respondents (18.6%) mostly only read
                terms and conditions partially, while 11 (10.8%) partially read them and 10 (9.8%) have
                sometimes read them thoroughly, but mostly read them only partially. Finally, a mere 2% (2)

            <br><p tabindex="0">
                This research aimed at understanding people’s awareness of their rights in regards to their
                online data, as well as their interest in having more control over it. The goal was to reach a
                pool of respondents from more than just the European Union, as done by the Special
                Eurobarometer 487a (European Union, 2019), so as to assess not only if data protection is a
                concern, but also if it is a global one.
            </p><br>
            <p tabindex="0">
                Although still mostly centered in the European continent due to the background of
                respondents, there was a certain level of diversity that allowed for us to draw preliminary
                conclusions about the global view on online privacy. As most of the answers suggest,
                individuals are, in fact, concerned at least to a certain extent with their privacy. They are
                often not willing to give up on services that may threaten it or spend time ensuring they fully
                understand all conditions around the use of a certain tool or website, but they are overall not
                oblivious to or unconcerned with the risks.
            </p><br>
            <p tabindex="0">
                Considering that there seems to be a market for solutions that concern protecting one’s
                online privacy, and that people do not seem to want to go to great lengths to ensure such
                protection, we believe that developing an application such as DataManage would be in the
                general interest. It could, in fact, allow people to have power over their own data through
                only a few clicks, minimising the amount of effort to put into action rights that people are
                often aware of but do not exercise regularly.
