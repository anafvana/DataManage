    Everything or anyone is accessible with a few clicks on your phone or computer. For so long, everyone thought this was a privilege until
    we finally woke to reality about how our data is managed. Controlling personal data has become the core-front to gain and influence people’s
    behavior. Companies are often after people's information for their own gain. People have never been more exposed when it comes to their own security
    in data protection. With this serious problem, our solution DataManage is finally here to address this issue effectively - a simple app that enables
    anyone to control who has access to their data.">

                Welcome to DataManage.<br>
                This is the Login Page.<br>
                At the top right you can find the language button.<br>
                By clicking on it, you will see at the centre of the page some language options.<br>
                In this case English and Norwegian.<br>
                For this video we are going to select English.<br>
                Now, back to the login page, we have two options:<br>
                To register with my ID, a Norwegian option, or to sign in.<br>
                We are going to first register, since we do not have a user yet.<br>
                To register with my ID, you can click on the «register with my ID» button in the middle of the screen.<br>
                A list of options will appear.<br>
                Select your preferred option to log in.<br>
                Once registered you will be directed to the main page.<br>
                Now, let’s sign out by clicking on the «sign out»-button in the top left corner.<br>
                Underneath the «register with myID» button, you can find the «sign in» button.<br>
                If you click this button you will get two options underneath.<br>
                To sign in with your personal code or your finger print.<br>
                If you click on «personal code» you can type in your personal code to log in.<br>
                Or you can click on the finger print button to use your finger print instead.<br>
