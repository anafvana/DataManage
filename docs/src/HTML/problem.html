    Everything or anyone is accessible with a few clicks on your phone or computer. For so long, everyone thought this was a privilege until
    we finally woke to reality about how our data is managed. Controlling personal data has become the core-front to gain and influence people’s
    behavior. Companies are often after people's information for their own gain. People have never been more exposed when it comes to their own security
    in data protection. With this serious problem, our solution DataManage is finally here to address this issue effectively - a simple app that enables
    anyone to control who has access to their data.">

            <br><p tabindex="0">We live in a world where our personal data is as valuable as our passport. Most of us keep our passport safe,
            but are we treating our personal information online with the same care?</p>
            <br><p tabindex="0">According to <i>We Are Social and Hootsuite’s research</i>, a million new people become internet users every day.
                With them comes their data. Pictures, likes, posts, pages visited, time online, this showcase some of the information belonging
                to over 4.3 billion individuals online.</p>
            <br><p tabindex="0">Websites, software and even internet providers gather your information daily for several reasons. From helping to
                identifying criminal activity to providing ads, there are many ways to justify collecting users’ data. However, that data is also
                valuable on the market. Your personal information can be sold or misused.</p>
                <br><h2 tabindex="0">How is my information being collected?</h2>
            <br><p tabindex="0">Your information can be collected in several different ways.  Usually, the user will be provided a service that
                asks for them to agree with certain terms and conditions. There, providers often include clauses that will allow them to collect
                and store data.</p>
            <br><p tabindex="0">We posted a survey online to get a better grasp on what people do with their personal information online.
                It was taken by people all over the world, of all ages and genders. Although most people that answered the survey were between
                the ages of 18 to 36 and from Norway, we still got valuable information from people from other parts of the world. The reason we did
                a worldwide survey was because we wanted to see how people feel about data privacy even if their countries do not have the same
                regulations as we do in Europe. A report based on the survey has been created, and you can find a link to this report on the "Source"-page.</p>
            <br><p tabindex="0">Our research suggests that only 2% of users always read the terms and conditions thoroughly. This means 98% of
                users are most likely consenting to things they do not understand.</p>

            2 % say they always read them thoroughly. 10.8% say they ready them partially. 9.8% say they read them thoroughly sometimes, but
            mostly partially read them. 18.6 % say they mostly only partially read them. 28.4 % say they almost never read or partially read

            <br><p tabindex="0">Your information can be used for all types of purposes, as long as some sort of consent is given. When you check the box
                “I have read and agree with the terms and conditions” or accept cookies, you consent.

            <br><p tabindex="0">That means your data is most likely negotiated in the stock market. In fact, over 19.2 billion dollars were invested on
                third-party audience data and data-use solutions in 2018. Therefore, if you think that ordinary people are not targeted, think again.
                As long as you are a potential consumer, your data is valuable and therefore sellable.</p>
            <br><h2 tabindex="0">Why should I care about this?</h2>
            <br><p tabindex="0">Our research shows that most people use the internet daily. This implies that they are also feeding websites, companies,
                data brokers and the likes with thousands of bits of information.</p>

                and further uses of their data. In short, it means that those who collect our data know a lot about us, but we don’t know much about them or how they
                are using it. This gives them the power.</p>
