    Everything or anyone is accessible with a few clicks on your phone or computer. For so long, everyone thought this was a privilege until
    we finally woke to reality about how our data is managed. Controlling personal data has become the core-front to gain and influence people’s
    behavior. Companies are often after people's information for their own gain. People have never been more exposed when it comes to their own security
    in data protection. With this serious problem, our solution DataManage is finally here to address this issue effectively - a simple app that enables
    anyone to control who has access to their data.">
